How is the roles working for you in the team?

 - Teamleader is not very active with managing and "controlling" the other, the teamleader should maybe have structured the group more
 - The role of the teamleader means for us a person who take the first initiative, controls the meetings, and to a certain extent structure the other groups members tasks. Teamleader also has the responsability of the project board 
 - The role of the customer contact for us is a person who communicates the tasks given by the customer
 - We think that it is not necessary to change any of the given roles at this point, we do not think it is necessary to add more roles either

Is there any experiences worth mentioning?

 - Team wise we work more efficently when we are meeting eachother
 - Project methodology wise we should try to structure us more, right now there is not enough progress on the project

How is the group team dynamic?
 - There may be too little activity when there is not meetings / group sessions
 - A solution to this might be to add another meeting during the week

How does the group communication work?
 
 - The communication is ok, the problem lies more on the lack of progression. 

Retroperspective

 - We have made tasks and tried to delegate task as our current project methodology states. 
 - On improvements we think as stated above that we should have a more structured project methodology where we have a more active task delegation instead of the passive version we have now. The teamleader should be more active on delegating tasks to the other team members. 
 
Commits

 - We do have a variation in the amount of commits, some have many commits, and others have fewer commits. Some explanation might be that some of the members have worked on a presentation which had a lot of commits. Furthermore we should be better at commiting several small commits, contra one large commit.
 - Some members have had exams which made them commit less because of a focus on working on the exam. 
 
Meeting summary since last deliverance
 
 - Last group session went to finishing the presentation, while some of the other members did code a little. The coding mostly was with the Robot/Player class, and trying to get the functionality of cards. Giving players cards, and making movement cards. 
 
Three keypoints to follow up on
 
 - Get a more structured group where we have a more active task delegation
 - Have more meetings 
 - Have more activity when there are not meetings

Demands from the customer

 - The tasks and demands we need to focus on forwards is getting functionality in the different classes and make them move more correctly on the map. Currently the movement is just a image moving, and therefore the logical functionality we have coded does not transfer to the board. Also getting the movement to be controlled by movement cards. 
 - Regarding the movement cards we have agreed upon having a card deck in game and make the game class delegate cards to the players. 
 
Priority
 
 - Make the robot move logical (actually move as a instance and not only as a picture)
 - Make movement cards which controls the movement
 - Dealing out cards to players
 - Have the game control phases and rounds
 - Functionality to the other classes on the board (conveyor belts, voids, flags etc.)
  
Changes in priority

 - Has not done any significant changes in priority
 
Verify that the demands are done

 - We will verify the demands by manual testing
 - We have already made some JUnit test, and those also have to run. Also make some new JUnit tests to verify that everything works as it should
 
Prior priorities

 - Getting a working game skeleton, we do have a working game skeleton now. Since last time we have made some logical changes in the different classes, but as stated before the problems lies with the movement and that it is not a logical movement, but a image moving.
