## Mandatory 4

### Deloppgave 1
 
Test role
* Magnus is our tester
 
 How is the group dynamic? 
 * The group dynamic is good, but we are a little passive when it comes to taking initiative and starting tasks
  
How does the communication work for you?
* Communication wise we have some problems, we are not good enough to respond to the other group members when they ask for something / try to organize group meetings


Retrospective
* We have more active delegation of tasks, which was something we had as a goal the last mandatory
* Regarding the remaining goals from last mandatory, we have not had more meetings, and we have not had more activity outside of meetings. This is something the group agrees that we should be better at

Three goals to the next sprint
* Better communication on Slack
* Help other members complete their task
* Every member send in weekly update (on slack) on what they have done / have not done (on tuesday)
