##Task 2:
The overall goal for the application will be to have a game where at least 2 people can play together, and there will be announced a winner and a loser at the end of the game.  
Our requirements for the game will be as follows:  
•	Able to play multiplayer  
•	Win/lose
•	A board  
•	Move the robots  
•	Hand out cards  
•	Visit flags  
•	Leave backup  
•	Repair damage  
•	Be destroyed by taking damage  
•	Shoot/activate lasers  
•	Make a program  
•	Powerdown  
•	Only one robot per square  
•	Priority for moves  
•	Taking damage results in less program cards to play  

For our first iteration our requirements will be as follows:  
•	A diagram over how we’ve chosen to organise the program  
•	Have a Github repo  
•	A board  
•	A piece/robot on the board

###Task 3:

We’ve chosen to use a hybrid between Kanban and SCRUM. Each member will only do one task at a time, and will be writing tests for what they are currently coding. Tests will be run frequently and we’ll be trying to have a sprint iteration each week.
Regarding the process and projectplan we went through and discussed each point systematicly, and every member got to give their own input.
For meetings we’ll require some agenda and we’ll have at least one meeting per week. In case of any issues(like a member being stuck on a task) we can call in for a troubleshooting meeting. For the sprint meetings each member will tell what they’ve done and how well it went as well as plan the next sprint.
For communication we’ll be using Slack for general talk and Trello to see who’s responsible for each task. Distribution of work also goes through Trello.
On each sprint meeting we’ll follow up on work and Trello will be used to see what’s done.
For sharing of documents, diagram and codebase we’ll have Google Docs, Github and Slack.
Google Docs will be for document with notes from meetings and other diverse notes. Github will be where our codebase is and Slack will also be for sharing of documents.
