##Task 2:  

The overall goal for the application will be to have a game where at least 2 people can play together, and there will be announced a winner and a loser at the end of the game.  
Our requirements for the game will be as follows:  
•	Able to play multiplayer  
•	Win/lose
•	A board  
•	Move the robots  
•	Hand out cards  
•	Visit flags  
•	Leave backup  
•	Repair damage  
•	Be destroyed by taking damage  
•	Shoot/activate lasers  
•	Make a program  
•	Powerdown  
•	Only one robot per square  
•	Priority for moves  
•	Taking damage results in less program cards to play  

For our first iteration our requirements will be as follows:  
•	A diagram over how we’ve chosen to organise the program  
•	Have a Github repo  
•	A board  
•	A piece/robot on the board

###Task 3:

We’ve chosen to use a hybrid between Kanban and SCRUM. Each member will only do one task at a time, and will be writing tests for what they are currently coding. Tests will be run frequently and we’ll be trying to have a sprint iteration each week.  
Regarding the process and projectplan we went through and discussed each point systematicly, and every member got to give their own input.  
For meetings we’ll require some agenda and we’ll have at least one meeting per week(thursday 10:15). In case of any issues(like a member being stuck on a task) we can call in for a troubleshooting meeting. For the sprint meetings each member will tell what they’ve done and how well it went as well as plan the next sprint.  
For communication we’ll be using Slack for general talk and Trello to see who’s responsible for each task. Distribution of work also goes through Trello.  
On each sprint meeting we’ll follow up on work and Trello will be used to see what’s done.  
For sharing of documents, diagram and codebase we’ll have Google Docs, Github and Slack.  
Google Docs will be for document with notes from meetings and other diverse notes. Github will be where our codebase is and Slack will also be for sharing of documents.  


### Retrospective -Group meeting 07.02.19
We discussed how the project is going so far, how everybody is doing, issues we had and tasks we think we solved in a good way. 
First the issues, we have had some problems and troubleshooting with git, first we made a private repo, before we got invited to the one from the group leader. 
So we lost a some time due to this issue. But during the meeting we solved the issues and all members are now in the same repo and all of us are able to push. 
We also agreed(last meeting) that the this week’s sprint would be difficult due to the limited task we’ve chosen, also because this is the first time we’ll work together. 
So the greatest challenge has been in finding a balance  on the amount of work to put on the project board. 
We have been struggling to make the tasks small enough so that the workload can easier distributed in the team.
We have agreed on a structure on the project so far, and have made a skeleton of the game to make it easier in the coming weeks as well as to visualize the layout of the structure now. 
We’ve agreed that the skeleton(all the smaller classes wrench, flag etc.) is not something we’re going to pursuit finishing at this point, they are only there now for us to have a better picture on how things may look further down the road. 
So we agreed to stop adding functionality and focusing on making what we have as good as possible.This means mostly making documentation in form of tests, comments and the class diagram.
