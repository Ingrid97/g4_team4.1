Meeting 11.04.2019
Attendance: Faltin, Brede, Ingrid and Sandra and Magnus
We talked about how we are trying to cover all the MVP criteria. Together we decided upon rather making a program meeting all the MVPâ€™s rather than spending time refactoring the code (making the code look prettier and more affiant) . 


Faltin: Fixed general movments of objects such as the belt, adding laser functions
Brede: powerdown 
Magnus: add tests
Ingrid: working on AI, lasers in the right directions
Sandra: Try making it possible to push robots, add test.  Think about the powerpoint presentation.
