Meeting 11.04.2019
Attendance: Faltin, Brede, Ingrid and Sandra and Magnus
We talked about how we are trying to cover all the MVP criteria. Together we decided upon rather making a program meeting all the MVPâ€™s rather than spending time refactoring the code (making the code look prettier and more affiant) . 
Faltin: Fixed general movments of objects such as the belt.
Brede: Fixing lasers, making it move in the right direction
Magnus: add tests
Ingrid: working on AI
Sandra: Try making it possible to push robots, add test.  Think about the powerpoint presentation.
