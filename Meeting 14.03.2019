First, we decided to connect all the different classes and their functionality with our map.
We notice that a lot of our methods don’t work on the actual map, therefore they game is not playable yet.


All of us got some taks to do within next week:
Faltin - Checking and correcting errors, make sure all the differente rounds work and a new robot method (work on game class)
Ingrid - Making player work with map, also work with GUI and visualization 
Brede - Optimize movement-cards functionality and how to divide them correctly between players ¬
Sandra – Finish menu functionality for game and divide the tasks on trello.
Magnus – add functional requirements
