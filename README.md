# INF112 Maven template 
Simple skeleton with libgdx. 


## Known bugs
Currently throws "WARNING: An illegal reflective access operation has occurred", 
when the java version used is > 8. This has no effect on function or performance, and is just a warning.


## Pictures
To run the main in game.java you need to add the following pictures to the 
inf112_dalek folder:
- blue_arrow.png
- flag.png
- gear.png
- hammer_screw.png
- laser.png
- nothing.png
- screw.png
- void.png
- wall_e.png
- yellow_arrow.png

The reason is the pictures is not done yet so do not want to just add random 
ugly pictures to the mvn-project
